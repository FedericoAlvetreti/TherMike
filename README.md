# TherMike
TherMike is a funny experiment we made from the very data collection to the model deployment with a [web app](https://termike-demo.streamlit.app/) based on some curious results in psychoacoustics. Apparently humans are able to discern some physical phenomenon retrieving inner patterns through their hearing: for example we can say wheter the water is hot or cold just by listening to its splash. The true hidden power of machine learning in our opinion is the possibility it offers to explain complex phenomena that sometimes slip away from our senses. So we dig deeper and deeper using a combination of tools from *functional data analysis* and *nonparametric statistics* to build a model capable to **listen the temperature of water**: TherMike predicts with a good range of error the temperature of water from the sound it makes when poured. 

TherMike is the final project for Statistical Learning course in Data Science M.Sc @Sapienza. The group was composed as follow:
- Lucia Dicunta
- Ioan Corrias
- Federico Alvetreti
- Leonardo Di Nino
